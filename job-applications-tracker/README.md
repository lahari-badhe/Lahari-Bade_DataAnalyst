# Job Applications Tracker

This project is a Notion-based system I built to track my full-time job applications as a Data Analyst.

While applying to jobs, I found it difficult to track application status, recruiter follow-ups, and visa sponsorship details across multiple platforms.  
This tracker helped me organize everything in one place.
