# Job Applications Tracker

This project is a Notion-based system I created to manage and track my full-time job applications as a Data Analyst.

While applying to roles across multiple platforms, I needed a simple and reliable way to track application status, recruiter follow-ups, interview stages, and visa sponsorship details. This tracker helped me organize everything in one place.
